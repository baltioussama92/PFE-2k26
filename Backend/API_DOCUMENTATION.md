## Missing Links Identified During Frontend Audit

The following backend links were identified as commonly needed by a real-estate React frontend and are now covered by the API:

1. **Image Upload (Multipart)**
   - Added: `POST /api/uploads/images`
   - Supports `multipart/form-data` (`file` field)

2. **Complex Search Filters (single query endpoint)**
   - Added/extended: `GET /api/listings/search` and `GET /api/listings/search/advanced`
   - Supports combining: `location`, `checkInDate`, `checkOutDate`, `minPrice`, `maxPrice`, `type`, `bedrooms`, `amenities`, `available`

3. **Admin Dashboard Stats Endpoint**
   - Existing metric endpoint: `GET /api/admin/growth-metrics`
   - Added compatibility alias: `GET /api/admin/stats`

4. **Real-time Conversations Structure (REST polling compatible)**
   - Added: `GET /api/messages/conversations`
   - Added: `GET /api/messages/conversations/{userId}`

## Notes for Report (PFE)
- API is RESTful with plural resources and standard HTTP verbs.
- RBAC is enforced with `@PreAuthorize`.
- Role names in frontend (`TENANT`, `PROPRIETOR`) are mapped to backend persisted roles (`GUEST`, `HOST`) through authority aliases.
- Uploaded files are served under `/uploads/**`.
